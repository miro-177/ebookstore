Indexes Created:
----------------
1. CREATE INDEX idx_bookId_loan ON loan(bookId);
2. CREATE INDEX idx_userId_loan ON loan(userId);

Affected Queries and Performance:
Query 1:
SELECT * FROM loan WHERE bookId = 123;

- Before index: ~210 ms
- After index (idx_bookId_loan): ~30 ms

Query 2:
SELECT * FROM loan WHERE userId = 456;

- Before index: ~190 ms
- After index (idx_userId_loan): ~25 ms

Query 3:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loan WHERE bookId = 123 AND returnDate IS NULL;

- Before index: ~235 ms
- After index (idx_bookId_loan): ~35 ms

The addition of indexes on `loan(bookId)` and `loan(userId)` significantly improved the response time of frequently used queries related to book loans and user loan history.

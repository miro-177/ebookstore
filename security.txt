Security.txt

Our website uses bcrypt password hashing to securely store passwords in our database.
When signing up, users type in their password and confirm it.
The program then uses the BCryptPasswordEncoder's .encode() function to hash the passwords.
These hashes passwords are stored in the database and are secure in the fact that the original password canot be found in the DB.

The data used in our program is generated by a Java file.
The file in question is .\finalProjectDBMS\src\main\java\uga\edu\cs\finalProjectDBMS\services\LibraryDataBuilder.java
Simply running this java file will populate the database with Books, Authors, Publishers, and all relations between them.

This file creates a list of 1000 random books and 20 random authors for filling out the DB. It also inserts the publishers.
It works by taking a list of first and last names and creating 20 random authors.
Then the program takes a list of key words and creates 1000 random book titles. They are also assigned a random publication year and publisher.
As the books are inserted into the DB they are paired with an author in the BookAuthor table.

The program also populates the database with three test users, 
it is done in this file so that the passwords could be encrypted as that was not possible with a simple SQL insert.
The test users are jackson@test.com, daisy@test.com, and miro@test.com. All three use 'password' as the password.
